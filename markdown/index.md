# Hello there!

You've stumpled upon my personal website/blog, welcome! This comes from a need to have somewhere to place my thoughts and rambling. 

My current role is at Carnegie Mellon University as a DevOps Engineer in Pittsburgh, PA. Previously I was a Computer Science/Information Technology
instructor with Kutztown University of PA. I have a M.S. ('19) and B.S. ('18) of Computer Science from KU. 

For your troubles here is a photo of my cat, Roger:
